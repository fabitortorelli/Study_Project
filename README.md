# Student mental health analysis

## Context
This project aims to analyze associations between depression (variable "Do you have Depression?") and other variables present in the dataset using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).


## Files
* **Dataset:** Available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health)
* **student-mental-health-analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) implementation and analysis

## Analysis Plan
1. **Data Preparation:**
* Load data and address missing values and duplicates

2. **Variable Adjustment:**
* Prepare variables, focusing on the variable related to depression and other relevant factors

3. **Multiple Correspondence Analysis:**
* Conduct MCA to explore relationships between variables
* Investigate associations between depression and other variables to understand patterns and correlations within student mental health data


# Top words from recipe name

## Context
This project aims to analyze recipe names from a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of healthy diet recipes, facilitating exploration through natural language processing (NLP) techniques to uncover insights from recipe names.

## Files
* **Dataset:** Available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/healthy-diet-recipes-a-comprehensive-dataset)
* **top-words-from-recipe-name.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing NLP analysis

## Analysis Plan
1. **Data Preparation:**
* Load data and address missing values and duplicates

2. **Variable Adjustment:**
* Prepare variables, focusing on relevant features from recipe names

3. **Relationship analysis:**
* Investigate relationships between variables Diet_type and Protein(g), Carbs(g) and Fat(g)

4. **NPL analysis:**
* Perform NLP techniques on recipe names, including tokenization, regex (regular expressions) for text processing, handling stop words, and stemming
* Generate a word cloud image to visualize frequently occurring words in recipe names, providing insights into popular ingredients or themes

# Univariate analysis

## Context
This project focuses on performing univariate analysis on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically exploring individual variables and their distributions.

## Files
* **Dataset:** Available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/passwords)
* **univariate-analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the univariate analysis

## Analysis Plan
## Analysis Plan
1. **Data Preparation:**
* Load data and address missing values and duplicates

2. **Variable Adjustment:**
* Prepare variables of interest for univariate analysis

3. **Univariate analysis:**
* Explore each variable individually to understand its distribution, central tendency, spread, and other relevant characteristics
* Utilize visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and summary statistics to summarize and interpret each variable's behavior
